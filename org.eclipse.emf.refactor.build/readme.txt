How to build EMF Refactor:
--------------------------
1. Run build_1.xml with ANT in the workspace. (Run AS -> ANT Build.. -> JRE -> Run in the same JRE as the workspace.)
   Important: Wait until PDE-Build in the lower right corner of eclipse is finished.
2. Run build_2.xml with ANT in the workspace. 

The build process will be revised in the future.
